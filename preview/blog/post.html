                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        When we started the migration project, we were dealing with Classic ASP applications
                        that had been running production for over 15 years. These weren't simple brochure sites—they
                        were critical engineering tools used daily across multiple manufacturing facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The biggest challenge wasn't the technology itself, but maintaining business continuity.
                        We couldn't afford downtime, and we couldn't risk losing functionality that engineers
                        depended on for their daily work.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="post-section">
                    <h2>Planning the Migration</h2>
                    <p>
                        We broke the migration into three phases:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Assessment and Architecture</strong> - Understanding what we had and designing the target state</li>
                        <li><strong>Incremental Migration</strong> - Moving functionality piece by piece, testing thoroughly</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimization</strong> - Taking advantage of modern platform capabilities</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This phased approach let us learn from early mistakes and adjust our strategy
                        before tackling the most complex parts of the system.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="post-section">
                    <h2>Technology Decisions</h2>
                    <p>
                        We chose Blazor WebAssembly for several reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our team already knew C# well from backend development</li>
                        <li>We could share models and logic between client and server</li>
                        <li>The component model was a good fit for our UI patterns</li>
                        <li>It integrated naturally with our existing .NET infrastructure</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="post-section">
                    <h2>Key Lessons Learned</h2>

                    <h3>1. Don't Translate, Rethink</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our first instinct was to port the old code directly. This was a mistake. The old applications
                        had grown organically over 15 years, accumulating workarounds and technical debt. A direct
                        port would just move that debt to a new platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, we used migration as an opportunity to rethink workflows and simplify where possible.
                        Some features that seemed critical turned out to be rarely used and could be removed entirely.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. State Management is Critical</h3>
                    <p>
                        Classic ASP applications relied heavily on server-side session state. Moving to a client-side
                        SPA meant rethinking how we handled state. We ended up with a hybrid approach—some state in
                        the browser for responsiveness, some server-side for security and consistency.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Performance Testing Under Load</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blazor WebAssembly has a different performance profile than server-side applications. The
                        initial load is heavier (downloading the .NET runtime and app DLLs), but subsequent interactions
                        are faster. We had to adjust user expectations and optimize the initial load experience.
                    </p>

                <section class="post-section">
                    <h2>The Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        After 18 months of work, we've successfully migrated three major applications. The benefits
                        have been significant:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Faster development cycles for new features</li>
                        <li>Better reliability and easier debugging with modern tooling</li>
                        <li>Improved user experience with responsive, interactive UIs</li>
                        <li>Easier onboarding for new developers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The investment was substantial, but the modernized applications are easier to maintain,
                        more reliable, and positioned for future enhancements.
                    </p>

                <section class="post-section">
                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        The migration taught us that legacy modernization isn't just about new technology—it's
                        about understanding why systems evolved the way they did and making deliberate choices
                        about what to preserve and what to rebuild.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're considering a similar migration, my advice is to start small, learn from each
                        phase, and don't underestimate the importance of having buy-in from the people who will
                        actually use the applications.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <!-- Code Example (optional) -->
                <section class="post-section">
                    <h2>Example: Shared Model Pattern</h2>
                    <p>
                        One pattern we found particularly useful was sharing models between client and server:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="code-block"><code>// Shared/Models/WorkOrder.cs
public class WorkOrder
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string OrderNumber { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
    public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }

    // Validation logic shared by client and server
    public bool IsValid() =>
        !string.IsNullOrEmpty(OrderNumber) &&
        CreatedDate > DateTime.MinValue;
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This eliminated duplication and ensured consistent behavior across the application.
                    </p>
