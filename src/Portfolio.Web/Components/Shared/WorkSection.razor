        <WorkItem Title="Application Modernization"
                  Description="Led the migration of legacy Classic ASP applications to modern Blazor WebAssembly on Microsoft Azure. The project required careful planning to avoid disrupting production while moving critical engineering applications to the cloud. The modernized apps are faster, easier to maintain, and provide a better experience for users across multiple manufacturing facilities." />

        <WorkItem Title="Enterprise Monitoring"
                  Description="Built out monitoring and logging infrastructure using Elastic APM and Serilog across our applications. Having real-time visibility into app performance and system health made a huge difference in how quickly we could respond to incidents. APM also became an essential tool during development—it's much easier to debug issues when you can see exactly what's happening under the hood." />

        <WorkItem Title="Manufacturing Integration"
                  Description="Built data integration solutions that connect plant floor systems with corporate databases and ERP systems across multiple facilities. These integrations handle real-time data flow between production equipment, quality systems, and reporting platforms. The systems need to stay up 24/7 to keep manufacturing running, so reliability and performance are critical." />

        <WorkItem Title="Custom Applications"
                  Description="Responsible for maintaining and creating small-to-medium sized applications to solve specific problems for process engineers and manufacturing plants. When a plant has a problem to solve or a process to streamline, we provide an application or enhancement tailored to their needs. This hands-on approach ensures manufacturing teams get the tools they need to work efficiently." />
