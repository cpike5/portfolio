        <p class="about-text">
            I'm a Full Stack .NET Developer with over 12 years of experience building
            enterprise applications for the automotive manufacturing industry. I specialize
            in modernizing legacy systems and migrating applications to Microsoft Azure.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            My expertise spans the entire stack—from C# and Blazor on the frontend to
            SQL Server and Elasticsearch on the backend. I'm passionate about creating
            reliable, scalable systems that solve real business problems.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            I believe in continuous learning and staying current with emerging technologies.
            I'm currently exploring LLM-assisted development workflows from design to
            implementation. I also enjoy mentoring developers and helping teams improve their
            practices.

            <h3 class="work-title">Application Modernization</h3>
            <p class="work-description">
                Led the migration of legacy Classic ASP applications to modern Blazor WebAssembly
                on Microsoft Azure. The project required careful planning to avoid disrupting production
                while moving critical engineering applications to the cloud. The modernized apps
                are faster, easier to maintain, and provide a better experience for users across
                multiple manufacturing facilities.

        <div class="work-item">
            <h3 class="work-title">Enterprise Monitoring</h3>
            <p class="work-description">
                Built out monitoring and logging infrastructure using Elastic APM and Serilog
                across our applications. Having real-time visibility into app performance and system
                health made a huge difference in how quickly we could respond to incidents. APM
                also became an essential tool during development—it's much easier to debug issues
                when you can see exactly what's happening under the hood.

        <div class="work-item">
            <h3 class="work-title">Manufacturing Integration</h3>
            <p class="work-description">
                Built data integration solutions that connect plant floor systems with corporate
                databases and ERP systems across multiple facilities. These integrations handle
                real-time data flow between production equipment, quality systems, and reporting
                platforms. The systems need to stay up 24/7 to keep manufacturing running, so
                reliability and performance are critical.

        <div class="work-item">
            <h3 class="work-title">Custom Applications</h3>
            <p class="work-description">
                Responsible for maintaining and creating small-to-medium sized applications to solve
                specific problems for process engineers and manufacturing plants. When a plant has a
                problem to solve or a process to streamline, we provide an application or enhancement
                tailored to their needs. This hands-on approach ensures manufacturing teams get the
                tools they need to work efficiently.
